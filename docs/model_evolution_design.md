# EADS Model Evolution Design

## Overview
Design document for implementing model evolution in the Evolutionary Autonomous Development System (EADS). This approach focuses on using evolutionary algorithms to discover optimal combinations of LLM models for different tasks rather than making assumptions about model capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Current Components
- **NLP Service**: Code analysis and understanding
- **GP Engine**: Evolutionary algorithms and optimization
- **Storage**:
  - Neo4j: Knowledge graph storage
  - Weaviate: Vector embeddings
  - PostgreSQL: Metadata and experiment tracking

### Performance Considerations
- Local vs Containerized Trade-offs:
  - Databases benefit from containerization (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Weaviate)
  - Compute-intensive operations better run locally (LLM inference, GPU operations)
  - WSL2 adds overhead for I/O operations

### Success Criteria Validation
```python
class SuccessValidator:
    """Validates if evolution results meet success criteria"""

    def __init__(self, criteria: dict):
        self.criteria = criteria

    def validate(self, results: dict) -> tuple[bool, dict]:
        """Check if results meet success criteria"""
        validations = {
            "performance_improved": self._check_performance(results),
            "tests_passing": self._check_tests(results),
            "cost_reasonable": self._check_costs(results),
            "results_consistent": self._check_consistency(results)
        }

        success = all(validations.values())
        return success, validations
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Error Handling
```python
class ModelExecutionError(Exception):
    """Custom error for model execution failures"""
    pass

class ValidationError(Exception):
    """Custom error for validation failures"""
    pass

def handle_model_error(error: Exception, strategy: ModelStrategy) -> None:
    """Handle model execution errors"""
    pass
```

### Caching
```python
class ResultsCache:
    """Caches model execution results"""

    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 1000):
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_size = max_size

    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[dict]:
        """Get cached result"""
        pass

    def set(self, key: str, value: dict) -> None:
        """Cache result"""
        pass
```

### Logging
```python
class EvolutionLogger:
    """Handles logging for the evolution process"""

    def __init__(self, log_level: str = "INFO"):
        self.logger = self._setup_logger(log_level)

    def log_generation(self, generation: int, stats: dict) -> None:
        """Log generation statistics"""
        pass

    def log_individual(self, individual: ModelStrategy, results: dict) -> None:

**Areas for Refinement and a More Focused Initial Experiment:**

* **Initial Experiment Simplicity:** For your *first* experiment, I strongly recommend starting with a much simpler setup. The current configuration is quite complex and might make it difficult to isolate and understand the effects of different evolutionary parameters. Start with a smaller number of models (maybe even just two), a simpler task, and a more basic evolutionary algorithm configuration.  This will make it easier to debug and analyze the results.  Once you have a working basic experiment, you can gradually add complexity.
* **Model "Strengths" -  Careful with Assumptions:**  While categorizing models by "strength" (analysis, generation, validation) is a reasonable starting point, be cautious about making strong assumptions about model capabilities.  LLMs are constantly evolving, and their relative strengths can change. Your evolutionary algorithm should ideally *discover* these strengths rather than relying on predefined categories.
* **Fitness Function - Concrete Metrics:** Your fitness function definition is a good start, but you'll need to define very concrete metrics for "performance," "correctness," "cost," and "time." How will you measure these?  For example, "correctness" might be measured by the percentage of test cases passed. "Performance" might be the execution time of the code generated by the models. Be precise in defining these metrics.  Start with simple metrics, then refine later.
* **Fallback Chain -  May Not Be Necessary Initially:**  The fallback chain is a good idea for robustness, but it adds complexity.  For the initial experiment, you might want to simplify by omitting the fallback mechanism and focusing on getting the basic evolution working with single model inferences.
* **Mutation Operators - Prioritize Key Operators:**  You've defined several mutation operators. For the first experiment, focus on the most important ones, like `swap_model` and perhaps `change_mode`. The other operators can be added later.  Again, start simple.
* **"Edge" - Define Clearly:** What constitutes an "edge" in this context?  What specific improvements are you hoping to achieve through model evolution (e.g., higher accuracy, lower cost, faster execution)? Define your success criteria more concretely.
* **Visualization:** Consider adding visualizations to track the evolution process (e.g., plots of fitness over generations, model usage distributions).  This will greatly aid in understanding and interpreting the results.



**Specific Suggestions for the First Experiment:**

1. **Simplified Task:** Choose a very simple task, perhaps even a synthetic one, to start with. This will allow you to focus on the evolution process itself rather than the complexities of the task. For example, you could use a simple mathematical function (like calculating factorials) or a basic string manipulation task.

2. **Two Models:** Start with just two LLMs, perhaps "claude" and "gpt4" (or any two you have easy access to).

3. **Basic Evolution:** Use a simple genetic algorithm configuration:
    * Smaller population size (e.g., 5).
    * Fewer generations (e.g., 3).
    * Tournament selection.
    * Single-point crossover.
    * `swap_model` mutation only.


4. **Concrete Fitness Function:**  Define clear, measurable metrics for your fitness function.  For example:
    * **Correctness:** Percentage of test cases passed.
    * **Performance:** Execution time of the generated code.
    * **Cost:** Total number of tokens used (as a proxy for cost).


5. **No Fallback Chain, Caching, or Complex Error Handling (Initially):**  Omit these for the first experiment to keep things simple.  Focus on the core evolution logic.



By starting with a simplified experiment, you'll be able to gain a better understanding of how the different components interact and how the evolutionary parameters affect the results. Once you have a working basic experiment, you can gradually add complexity, incorporate more models, and refine the fitness function, mutation operators, and other aspects of the system.  Your current plan is a good roadmap for the long term, but a more focused initial experiment will significantly increase your chances of early success and provide valuable insights for further development.








# EADS: Evolutionary Autonomous Development System - "Hello, Evolution" Experiment

This document outlines the design and implementation of a simplified "Hello, Evolution" experiment within the Evolutionary Autonomous Development System (EADS).  This experiment serves as a foundational starting point for exploring multi-inference model evolution, focusing on discovering optimal combinations of LLMs for a specific task.

## Goal

The primary goal of this initial experiment is to establish a functional evolutionary algorithm framework that can evolve combinations of two LLMs for a simple task, demonstrating the core principles of model evolution.  We will focus on understanding the basic dynamics of the evolutionary process and how different parameters affect the results.

## System Architecture

### Components

* **Evolution Manager:**  Manages the evolutionary algorithm, including population initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.
* **Model Executor:** Executes code generated by LLMs and collects performance metrics.
* **LLM Interfaces:**  Wrappers for interacting with specific LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT-4).


### Technology Choices

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **LLMs:**  Claude and GPT-4 (or any two readily available LLMs).
* **Evolutionary Algorithm Library:**  DEAP (or a custom implementation if desired).


## Experiment Design

### 1. Task:  Fibonacci Calculation

For simplicity, the initial task will be to generate Python code that efficiently calculates the nth Fibonacci number.  This task is well-defined, easy to implement, and allows for clear performance measurement.

### 2. LLMs

We will use two LLMs initially: Claude and GPT-4 (or any two readily available LLMs).  The goal is to discover if and how combining these LLMs can lead to better performance than using either one individually.  We will start *without* predefined assumptions about the strengths of each model.  Let the evolution discover which model performs which subtask best!

### 3. Model Representation (Genome)

A "model strategy" (individual in the population) will be represented as a simple list: `[model_for_generation, model_for_validation]`. where the first model is what is used to generate code, and the second model evaluates it. For example, `["claude", "gpt4"]` indicates that Claude is used for code generation and GPT-4 for validation.

### 4. Fitness Function

The fitness function will combine three metrics:

* **Correctness (70%):** Percentage of test cases passed.
* **Performance (20%):** Execution time of the generated code (lower is better).
* **Cost (10%):** Total number of tokens used by both models (lower is better).

The weights assigned to each metric reflect the prioritization of correctness, followed by performance and then cost.  These can be adjusted in later experiments.  The fitness function will be calculated as:
```
fitness = 0.7 * correctness + 0.2 * (1 / performance) + 0.1 * (1 / cost)
```
The performance and cost metrics will be inverted so that higher values contribute to higher fitness.

### 5. Test Cases

We will use a set of test cases with various inputs (n values for Fibonacci calculation) and expected outputs to evaluate the correctness of the generated code.  Examples include edge cases, large values of `n`, or different data types, like so:

```python
test_cases = [
    {"input": 0, "expected": 0},
    {"input": 1, "expected": 1},
    {"input": 5, "expected": 5},
    {"input": 10, "expected": 55},
    {"input": 20, "expected": 6765}, #Larger value test
    {"input": -1, "expected": "ValueError"},  # Edge case
    {"input": "string", "expected": "TypeError"},  # Edge case
]
```

### 6. Evolutionary Algorithm Configuration

* **Population Size:** 5
* **Generations:** 3 (for the initial experiment). Can increase in later experiments
* **Selection:** Tournament selection with tournament size 2.  Simple and efficient.
* **Crossover:**  None. Since our genome is very simple for now, we don't do crossover
* **Mutation:** `swap_model`: Swaps the models used for generation and validation with a probability of 20%.
* **Elitism:** Keep the best individual from each generation. This strategy preserves top solutions.


## Implementation Details

### Model Executor
The Model Executor will be responsible for:
1. Sending prompts to the specified LLMs to generate Python code for Fibonacci calculation.  The specific prompts for code generation will need to be created.
2. Executing the generated code using `exec()` within a safe and controlled environment (e.g., using a sandboxed execution environment to prevent malicious code execution).  The test harness to run and validate each output will need to be created.
3. Measuring the execution time of the generated code.
4. Recording the number of tokens used by each LLM call.
5. Handling any errors during execution and returning appropriate error messages or default values for the fitness metrics.

### Evolution Manager
The Evolution Manager will:
1. Initialize a population of model strategies randomly.
2. Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population using the Model Executor.
3. Apply tournament selection and elitism to create a new generation.
4. Apply `swap_model` mutation to introduce variation.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the specified number of generations.
6. Return the best-performing model strategy found during the evolution process.

## Evaluation and Analysis

The results of the "Hello, Evolution" experiment will be analyzed to:

* Understand the dynamics of the evolutionary process.
* Determine if evolving combinations of models can outperform individual models.
* Identify the relative strengths and weaknesses of each model for the given task.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen fitness function, mutation operators, and other evolutionary parameters.

We will track the fitness of the best individual and the average fitness of the population over generations to assess the progress of evolution.  We will also analyze the frequency of different model combinations in the final population to understand how the evolutionary process has explored the model strategy space.


## Future Work

After the initial experiment, we can expand EADS by:

* **More Complex Tasks:**  Introduce more complex programming tasks involving different data structures, algorithms, or libraries.
* **More LLMs:** Incorporate more LLMs into the evolution process.
* **Advanced Model Representation:**  Explore more sophisticated representations of model strategies, such as allowing for different models to handle different subtasks within a more complex task.
* **Fine-grained Mutation Operators:** Develop more specialized mutation operators that can modify individual model parameters, prompt templates, or other aspects of the model strategy.
* **Dynamic Parameter Tuning:** Implement mechanisms for dynamically adjusting evolutionary parameters (e.g., mutation rate, population size) during the evolution process.
* **Integration with Knowledge Graph and Vector Database:** Leverage Neo4j and Weaviate to store and retrieve code examples, model performance data, and other relevant information.
