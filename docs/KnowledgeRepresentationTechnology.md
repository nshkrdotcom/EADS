# Knowledge Representation Technology

1. Specification Representation:
- Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for formal specifications [Graph DB]
- Semantic flow graphs capturing dependencies and relationships between components [Graph DB]
- Symbolic representations of mathematical constructs and algorithms [Graph DB]
- Requirement-to-implementation traceability matrices [Relational DB]
- Specification embeddings for semantic similarity and search [Vector DB]

2. Code Representation:
- Program Dependence Graphs (PDGs) [Graph DB]
- Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) [Graph DB]
- Call Graphs [Graph DB]
- Code embeddings for semantic code search and similarity [Vector DB]
- Abstract Semantic Graphs (ASGs) for deep code understanding [Graph DB]

3. Knowledge Representation:
- Ontological relationships between concepts [Graph DB]
- Implementation pattern templates [Relational DB]
- Semantic embeddings of documentation and comments [Vector DB]
- Type hierarchies and inheritance relationships [Graph DB]
- Cross-reference resolution indices [Relational DB]

4. Verification State:
- Proof trees and verification conditions [Graph DB]
- State transition systems [Graph DB]
- Invariant relationships [Graph DB]
- Test coverage maps [Relational DB]
- Verification result caches [Relational DB]

Some key papers that have influenced automated software development include work on:
