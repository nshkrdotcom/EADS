# &#x1F9EC; EADS: Evolutionary Autonomous Development System

## &#x1F680; Paradigm-Shifting Software Engineering

EADS represents a revolutionary approach to autonomous software development, leveraging advanced AI, genetic programming, and adaptive learning to create a self-evolving software engineering ecosystem.

This project aims to build an Evolutionary Automated Development System (EADS) for generating, testing, and refining software applications through iterative evolution. EADS leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Programming (GP), and advanced analysis techniques to create robust and adaptable software.  This system is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and adaptable to various software development tasks, exceeding the capabilities of traditional manual or even simpler automated systems.

### Planned Components

The following components are planned for future implementation:

1. **Infrastructure & Deployment**
   - Kubernetes orchestration for production scaling
   - Enhanced monitoring and logging
   - Service mesh implementation

2. **Code Analysis & Verification**
   - CBMC/KLEE for formal verification
   - DynamoRIO/Frida for dynamic analysis
   - Additional vector store integration (Pinecone)

3. **Enhanced ML Capabilities**
   - CodeBERT integration

Each component in our current stack has been carefully selected and integrated into the system. The stack is modular by design, allowing for easy updates and replacements as the project evolves.

## &#x1F4AC; Vision

To create a self-healing, continuously improving software ecosystem that autonomously adapts to emerging technological landscapes.

## &#x1F527; Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Linux/WSL2 environment (recommended)
- System packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv python3-pip
  ```

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nshkrdotcom/EADS.git
   cd EADS
   ```

2. **Run Setup Script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This script will:
   - Install required system packages
   - Create Python virtual environment
   - Make initialization scripts executable

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   ./install_requirements.sh
   ```
   This installs:
   - Core dependencies (FastAPI, DEAP, etc.)
   - Development tools (black, flake8, etc.)
   - ML libraries (TensorFlow, Sentence Transformers)

5. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Configure the following in your `.env`:
   - Database connections (Neo4j, PostgreSQL)
   - Weaviate settings
   - Ray cluster configuration
   - MLflow tracking
   - DVC remote storage

### Development Setup

1. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
   This sets up:
   - Code formatting (black)
   - Import sorting (isort)
   - Linting (flake8)
   - Type checking (mypy)

2. **Initialize Services**
   ```bash
   ./init.sh
   ```
   This script:
   - Starts Docker services (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, Weaviate)
   - Verifies service health
   - Sets up initial database schemas
   - Configures MLflow tracking

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   ./init.sh start
   ```

2. **Code Quality**
   - Format code: `black .`
   - Sort imports: `isort .`
   - Type check: `mypy .`
   - Run linter: `flake8`

3. **Running Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest

   # Run with coverage
   pytest --cov=src tests/

   # Run async tests
   pytest tests/ --asyncio-mode=auto
   ```

4. **Local Development**
   - NLP Service: `uvicorn src.nlp.nlp_service:app --reload --port 8000`
   - GP Engine: `uvicorn src.gp_engine.gp_service:app --reload --port 8001`
   - API docs at:
     - NLP: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
     - GP: `http://localhost:8001/docs`

5. **Stop Services**
   ```bash
   ./init.sh stop
   ```

### Troubleshooting

1. **Service Health Check**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   docker-compose logs
   ```

2. **Database Connections**
   - Neo4j Browser: `http://localhost:7474`
   - Weaviate Console: `http://localhost:8080`
   - PostgreSQL: Use any SQL client with credentials from `.env`

3. **Common Issues**
   - Port conflicts: Check if ports 7474, 7687, 8080, 5432 are available
   - Memory issues: Ensure Docker has sufficient memory allocation
   - Permission errors: Run `chmod +x` on shell scripts

### Production Deployment

Currently, we use Docker Compose for development and testing. Production deployment with Kubernetes is planned for future releases.

### Available Services

When running, you can access:
- Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474 (web interface)
- NLP Service: http://localhost:8000 (API endpoint)
- GP Engine: http://localhost:8001 (API endpoint)
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432 (database server)
  ```
  Connection details:
  Host: localhost
  Port: 5432
  User: postgres
  Password: password
  Database: eads
  ```

## Configuration

The system uses environment variables for configuration. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required settings:
- Neo4j: Database for knowledge graph (`NEO4J_*` variables)
- PostgreSQL: Database for metadata (`POSTGRES_*` variables)

## &#x1F063; System Architecture

EADS employs a modular microservices architecture:

1. **GP Service (`gp_engine`):**
   - Manages code evolution through genetic programming
   - Handles population initialization and evolution
   - Configurable evolution parameters
   - RESTful API endpoints for evolution operations

2. **NLP Service (`nlp`):**
   - Code analysis using transformer models
   - Pattern matching and similarity computation
   - RESTful API endpoints for NLP operations
   - Configurable model selection

3. **Knowledge Base:**
   - Neo4j graph database for storing code patterns, relationships, and metadata
   - Asynchronous database operations
   - Structured knowledge representation
   - Environment-based configuration

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - Service-specific configuration
   - Logging configuration
   - Development and production settings
