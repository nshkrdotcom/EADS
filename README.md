  - The system will work without Pinecone, but some advanced features may be limited

## &#x1F063; System Architecture

EADS employs a modular architecture, integrating several key components:

1. **Knowledge Base:**  A richly structured knowledge base encompassing code examples, design patterns, libraries, best practices, and security guidelines.  This is used to inform the AI Engine and the GP Engine.  This incorporates a robust and scalable Graph Database (Neo4j) to store code taxonomies and architectural knowledge, and a semantic embedding layer (Pinecone) to facilitate intelligent code search and retrieval.


2. **Decentralized AI Engine:** Multiple specialized AI modules (security, performance, maintainability, etc.), leveraging deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, collaborate to generate, analyze, and optimize code.  This design enhances resilience and allows for focused expertise.


3. **Genetic Programming Engine:** This component utilizes a robust GP engine (DEAP or PyGAD) for code evolution. It uses sophisticated techniques like AST manipulation, semantic embedding-guided crossover, and LLM-enhanced mutation and code generation, leveraging the CodeBERT model for advanced code understanding.


4. **Robustness Enhancement Module:** Performs comprehensive code analysis (static and dynamic) and formal verification (where feasible) to identify potential issues.  It utilizes static analysis tools (PMD, FindBugs, SonarQube, etc.), dynamic instrumentation (DynamoRIO, Frida), and potentially model checkers (CBMC, KLEE).  This generates a robustness score and specific feedback.


5. **Deployment and Monitoring:** A robust pipeline (managed by Apache Airflow) that deploys the generated code to ASKA using Docker containers, and monitors performance, resource usage, security, and user feedback.  It integrates with Kubernetes for scaling and resilience.


6. **Metadata Management:**  A relational database (Postgres) stores experiment tracking data, version control information, fitness scores, metrics, logs, and compliance data.


7. **Human-Machine Interface:**  A user-friendly interface for developers to interact with and guide the EADS, providing feedback, setting goals, and reviewing results.
