# &#x1F9EC; EADS: Evolutionary Autonomous Development System

## &#x1F680; Paradigm-Shifting Software Engineering

EADS represents a revolutionary approach to autonomous software development, leveraging advanced AI, genetic programming, and adaptive learning to create a self-evolving software engineering ecosystem.

This project aims to build an Evolutionary Automated Development System (EADS) for generating, testing, and refining software applications through iterative evolution. EADS leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Programming (GP), and advanced analysis techniques to create robust and adaptable software.  This system is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and adaptable to various software development tasks, exceeding the capabilities of traditional manual or even simpler automated systems.

## &#x1F527; Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites


### Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nshkrdotcom/EADS.git
   cd EADS
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   # Set permissions
   chmod +x ./*.sh

   # Run setup script to create virtual environment
   ./setup.sh

   # Activate virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Install Python requirements
   ./install_requirements.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # The .env.example contains development defaults:
   # - Neo4j password: "password"
   # - Postgres password: "password"
   # You can keep these defaults for development
   ```

4. **Initialize System**
   ```bash
   # Initialize EADS components
   ./init.sh
   ```

5. **Build Docker Services** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Only needed if you modified Dockerfiles
   ./build.sh
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Development Session**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment
   docker-compose up -d       # Start Docker services
   ```

2. **Connect to PostgreSQL**
   ```bash
   # Using psql CLI:
   psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d eads
   # Password: password

   # Alternative GUI clients:
   # - pgAdmin 4: Popular PostgreSQL GUI (https://www.pgadmin.org/)
   # - DBeaver: Universal database tool (https://dbeaver.io/)
   # - DataGrip: JetBrains database IDE (https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
   ```

3. **Stop Development Session**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down  # Stop Docker services
   deactivate          # Exit virtual environment
   ```

### Development Tools

The project includes several development tools to maintain code quality.

#### Initial Setup

1. **Install System Packages** (Ubuntu/Debian)
   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit
   sudo apt install pre-commit

   # Install Python development tools
   sudo apt install python3-dev
   ```

2. **Install Python Development Requirements**
   ```bash
   # Make sure your virtual environment is active
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Install requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   # Install the pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install

   # Run all hooks initially
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

#### Using Development Tools

1. **Code Formatting**
   ```bash
   # Format code with black
   black .

   # Sort imports
   isort .
   ```

2. **Code Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   # Run flake8
   flake8 .

   # Run mypy type checking
   mypy .
   ```

3. **Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run tests with coverage
   pytest

   # View coverage report
   open htmlcov/index.html
   ```

4. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   pre-commit install

   # Run hooks manually
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

These tools are automatically installed with the development requirements. The pre-commit hooks will run automatically on git commit to ensure code quality.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter Docker permission issues:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
# Log out and log back in for changes to take effect
```

The system uses environment variables for configuration. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required settings:
- Neo4j: Database for knowledge graph (`NEO4J_*` variables)
- PostgreSQL: Database for metadata (`POSTGRES_*` variables)


## &#x1F063; System Architecture

EADS employs a modular microservices architecture:

1. **GP Service (`gp_engine`):**
   - Manages code evolution through genetic programming
   - Handles population initialization and evolution
   - Configurable evolution parameters
   - RESTful API endpoints for evolution operations

2. **NLP Service (`nlp`):**
   - Code analysis using transformer models
   - Pattern matching and similarity computation
   - RESTful API endpoints for NLP operations
   - Configurable model selection

3. **Knowledge Base:**
   - Neo4j graph database for storing code patterns, relationships, and metadata
   - Asynchronous database operations
   - Structured knowledge representation
   - Environment-based configuration

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Environment variables for sensitive data
   - Service-specific configuration
   - Logging configuration
   - Development and production settings
